### Hello!
## I'm MagneticPrism! I am a programmer and modder for Geometry Dash. I mainly write my code in C++ but i also know C, a tiny bit of Java and C#, and some basic Python and JavaScript.
## I am also working on some games but I don't know what to make. 

## Anyway, I enjoy programming as a hobby!

### Now here is some info on how i started programming:
  # When I was in grade nine, I looked up on the school computer how games are made.
  # I then started exploring ways on the internet to get started with game development without programming.
  # This was tough since I could not find anything i liked at the time.
  # I then discovered The Unity Game Engine a few days later.
  # Although, this was more complicated since it required knowledge in C#.
  # I started looking on YouTube for some videos about learning C# and how to use Unity.
  # For the remainder of the year, i started learning Unity and made small test games.
  # I started to have a little fun but, i had then stopped for a bit after the new year started.
  # Why I stopped you may ask? Well, I had gotten into music production and other things at the time and hesitated to program.
  # Later that year around mid to late summer, I had started back up programming but instead of using C#, I started learning C++ and modding Geometry Dash with it.
  # This is when I started to have even more fun with programming!
  # After that, I had started messing around with C++ and even C for a bit.
  # Sadly, I had to leave home and not be active at all wnile I was gone.
  # The reason why I left is not to be discussed at all.
  # But after I got home this year, October 15 2022, I continued to do more programming in C++!
  # As a relult of being gone for so long, I had gotten a little bit rusty is what I like to call it when I had not done something in a long time.
  # But all that aside, here I am writing this now!
