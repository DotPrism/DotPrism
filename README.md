# Hello! I'm MagneticPrism!
#### I am a programmer and modder for Geometry Dash. I mainly write my code in C++ but i also know C, a tiny bit of Java and C#, and some basic Python and JavaScript.
#### I am also working on some games but I don't know what to make. 

#### Anyway, I enjoy programming as a hobby!

# How I started programming:
  #### When I was in grade nine, I looked up on the school computer how games are made.
  #### I then started exploring ways on the internet to get started with game development without programming.
  #### This was tough since I could not find anything I liked at the time.
  #### I then discovered The Unity Game Engine a few days later.
  #### Although, this was more complicated since it required knowledge in C#.
  #### I started looking on YouTube for some videos about learning C# and how to use Unity.
  #### For the remainder of the year, I started learning Unity and made small test games.
  #### I started to have a little fun but, I had then stopped for a bit after the new year started.
  #### Why I stopped you may ask? Well, I had gotten into music production and other things at the time and hesitated to program.
  #### Later that year around mid to late summer, I had started back up programming but instead of using C#, I started learning C++ and modding Geometry Dash with it.
  #### This is when I started to have even more fun with programming!
  #### After that, I had started messing around with C++ and even C for a bit.
  #### Sadly, I had to leave home and not be active at all while I was gone.
  #### The reason why I left is not to be discussed at all.
  #### But after I got home this year, October 15 2022, I continued to do more programming in C++!
  #### As a relult of being gone for so long, I had gotten a little bit rusty is what I like to call it when I had not done something in a long time.
  #### But all that aside, here I am writing this now!
